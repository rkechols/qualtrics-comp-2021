# Qualtrics Programming Competition, November 2021

Competition on [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/q-hack-2021), November 13, 2021.

Passing solutions to all problems.

Ample credit goes to Lawry and Kevin, the other two members of my team.

Our team did not solve the problems "Fraudulent Activity Notifications" and "Balanced Forest" during the competition.  
These two were solved "posthumously".

Note that test #5 of "Balanced Forest" includes an expected output of `0`, even though this is outside of the problem's specified constraints
(which explainins why no competitors managed to pass all tests for this problem during the competition, while tests were hidden).
